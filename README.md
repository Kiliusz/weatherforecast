# Weather App

Weather App using free plan of WeatherAPI.com

## Libraries

- React (CRA)
- Typescript
- Material-UI
- axios
- React-Query
- Jest / React Testing Library

## Description

- Unfortunately WeatherAPI.com provides only forecast for 3 days (using free plan).
- For history data it only gives 1 day not older than 1 week
- Material UI and React-Query might be a bit overkill for this app.
